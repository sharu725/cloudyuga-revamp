Last weekend on 4th and 5th Feb&#8217;17 we hosted our 2nd [Go language workshop](https://golang.org) by [Shiju Varghese.](https://twitter.com/shijucv)  This is first 2 days workshop we did it our office.<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Sometimes it becomes difficult to do trainings when there are less participants. This time we had only 3 participants, which does make much financial sense but we still did it.  We often see cancellation in such cases. We try our best to do the workshop if it can cover the basic cost. I did a workshop earlier when only participant signed up. Thanks to Shiju for coming down from Kochi for this workshop.

It was also good to see that participants are coming back to us for other trainings.  2 of 3 participants attended my Docker workshop last year.

As a value add we have given complimentary access to each participant of our [Containers Fundamentals MOOC](http://school.cloudyuga.guru), which we launched last month.

We hope to keep providing such high quality trainings in future. We have following trainings lined up for next 2 months :-

  1. [ElasticSearch Training by Mohit Sethi &#8211; 25th and 26th Feb&#8217;17](http://www.cloudyuga.guru/?page_id=440)
  2. [Docker (Containers) workshop  18th and 19th March](http://www.cloudyuga.guru/?page_id=35) 
  3. [Go workshop by Shiju Varghese April 7th and 8th. ](http://www.cloudyuga.guru/?page_id=274)
