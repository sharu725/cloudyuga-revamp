## **Overview** 

This course covers basic and advance level of Docker. We will start looking to container fundamentals and then do a deep dive into Docker architecture, container and image operations. We will see how manage network and data with Docker. We’ll see how we can create multi container applications using Docker Compose.&nbsp; We will also Docker Swarm which is a container orchestrator for Docker and would deploy application using Docker Stack. At last we would cover Docker Security, Performance and monitoring aspect as well.&nbsp;

**Date**: TBD 

**Venue** : Bangalore
