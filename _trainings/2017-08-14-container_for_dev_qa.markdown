## **Overview** 

**Containers (Docker) for Dev and QA course** is a *self paced* online course, which would help you implement end to end CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Visual Studio Code and Jenkins. In the course we would cover :-

- Review Docker basics
- Setup development environment with Visual Studio Code and Docker
- Learn about Jenkins
- Learn how to Docker to create dynamic Jenkins Slave
- Learn how to use Jenkins pipeline feature with Docker to CI/CD flow
- Learn about container orchestration and use Docker Swarm to setup production environment
- Learn about end-to-end workflow from Development to Production
- Learn about Microservices 

This course follows completely hands-on approach to learn about containers. To have a consistent lab environment we have partnered with DigitalOcean to provide self service lab. Each new or existing user of DigitalOcean would get **$15 credit** to perform the labs.
