Today is a big day for [CloudYuga](http://www.cloudyuga.guru).  We launched our first [MOOC on containers technologies &#8211; Containers Fundamentals.](http://school.cloudyuga.guru) It has been a great learning experience. Though I was doing open batches and getting some corporate trainings but I had to say NO many times because I could not be at two places at the same time.  Also I can not travel around all the time and deliver trainings. As anyone I wanted to scale and that is when I decided go online.

After deciding to go online I saw that there are lots of online courses available on Docker on different platforms. So why should someone come to our platform. One thing was clear that we should bring some additional value. We tried to do that three ways :-

  1. We covered container fundamentals in detail so the participants would get solid foundation on container technologies.
  2. Though [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is primary focus in course but we covered [runC](https://runc.io) and [Rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt) as well.
  3. We partnered with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com), so that every participant would get same lab environment.

Here is a sample video from the course :-

It took around 6 months to come to today&#8217;s launch. It was an interesting journey and we hit a mile-stone today. This is the beginning  and we&#8217;ll be coming up with more courses in coming months.
  
Today I announced the course publicly first time at [Digital Ocean meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DigitalOceanBangalore/events/236353004/), where I have a talked Docker 1.13, which would be releasing soon. Thanks to DigitalOcean for collaborating with us for the MOOCs.  In the evening we had a small launch party at our office with few friends.

One can use **CYSCHOOLLAUNCH40 **coupon  to get 40% off while signing up for the course.

Its is an uncharted territory for me which might open up different avenues. Only the time will tell. I am happy that I did this and would be doing few more pretty soon. Happy learning !!!
