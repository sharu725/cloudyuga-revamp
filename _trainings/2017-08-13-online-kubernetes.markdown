## **Overview** 

This course covers Kubernetes, which is the dominant container orchestrator. We will look at the history
and evolution of Kubernetes and learn about different resources such as Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.
This course also covers how to deploy, update, maintain microservices based applications on Kubernetes
using various Kubernetes constructs. The course also discusses access methods, networking, volume
management, logging and monitoring, and many more advanced topics. Throughout the course, hands-on
exercises reinforce the concepts discussed.

This course will also prepare you to take [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/) exam. CKA is an industry standard exam exam, which would help the individual to establish the credibility and value in the job market. This 3 hour long pratical exam is offered by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).  

## **Registration Details**

## **Testimonials**

> Docker & Kubernetes was a very informative class. Neependra is very knowledgeable and kept the right pace to not only get through the Training material but More Focus is also on the Live demo, but to also answer questions. I would definitely take another class with Neependra and CloudYuga. This training session was extremely helpful. Key differentiation with Neependra is he is able to stretch extra mile by helping and advising any sort of problems and Issue in the Containers space out of the class. Keep up the good work and all the best.  [Satish Anandhan, IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satishanandhan/)
