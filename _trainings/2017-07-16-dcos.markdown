## **Overview** 



In this course we would cover basic and advance DC/OS, with focus on containerised applications which are deployed using Marathon framework. We would look at different concept of DC/OS and how it is related to Mesos. We would deploy DC/OS on cloud and then deploy different applications. We would explore service discovery, blue-green deployment, canary deployment and auto-scaling as well. We would also explore storage and network management with DC/OS. At last we would cover logging, monitoring and troubleshooting with DC/OS.&nbsp;

**Date**: TBD

**Venue** : Bangalore
