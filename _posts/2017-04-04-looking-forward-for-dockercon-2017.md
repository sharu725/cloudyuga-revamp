I am very excited to attend the [DockerCon 2017 in Austin between 17th to 20th April this year](http://2017.dockercon.com). There are multiple reasons to :-

  * I would be representing [CloudYuga](http://www.cloudyuga.guru) at DockerCon
  * [Ajeet](https://twitter.com/ajeetsraina) and I would be doing a Docker 101 workshop to DockerCon participants
  * I would be Meeting fellow [Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains)  and Docker Meetup Organisers from around the world

This would be my 3rd DockerCon. I attended [my first one in SF while I was part of Red Hat](http://neependra.net/?p=1342).  In 2016 I attended DockerCon in Seattle on my own and same is going to be this year. Conferences like DockerCon pump up so much energy that one can stay motivated for almost a year. There are going be many interesting talks and I would be able to attend just few :(. The most important part of any such conference is that you get the chance to meet so many interesting and important people.

This time all 3 of the Docker Captains from India [Ajeet Raina](https://twitter.com/ajeetsraina), [Sreenivas Makam](https://twitter.com/srmakam) and I would be attending the DockerCon. Sreenivas would also be delivering one of the workshop as well. We will share our experiences with the [Docker Community in Bangalore and India](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/).

I had created a quick tip on Docker Execution Driver for DockerCon promotion as well.



If you liked the video then you might want to check out our [online course on Containers Fundamentals](http://school.cloudyuga.guru). We&#8217;ll be launching our container course targeted to Developers and QA Engineers pretty soon.

I am sure DockerCon&#8217;17 is going to be one great event for me and CloudYuga. I&#8217;ll share another blog post when I would be back from DockerCon&#8217;17 !!!!
