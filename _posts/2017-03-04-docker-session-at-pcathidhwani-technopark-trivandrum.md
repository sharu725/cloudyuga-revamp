Today I delivered a Docker 101 session at Trivandrum for <span style="color: #0000ee"><u>Prathidhwani</u></span>. Prathidhwani is Socio Cultural Organisation for [Technopark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technopark,_Trivandrum) Employees Employees.

In Jan&#8217;s Docker meetup [Shahinshah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahinshah-rawther-a9670340/) reached out to me do a session in Trivandrum.  He connected me to [Bibin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibin-vasudevan-49884b22/) who followed up with me after that.  After few discussions we decided to do it on 4th March. As it was community event, I did not charge anything. I think it as our responsibility make people know about new technologies. How they can save time, money and at the same time upgrade the skill-set to keep them relevant.

I reached Trivandrum at 9:40 AM and went directly to the venue. More than 300 people registered and ~15o people showed up, which is really good. We started the session on time 11 AM and finished on time at 3:30 PM. Most of participants were new to Docker and containers in general.

The audience was interactive and asked good questions. I enjoyed giving my session there.  I hope they also learned something new. During the session I also asked few questions to participants and gave away few subscriptions of my [Containers Fundamentals course](http://school.cloudyuga.guru).

After the session Bibin, Shahinshah and I went to [Kovalam beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kovalam). I took the 10 PM flight and came back to Bangalore. Overall it was very good trip.  Thanks <u>Prathidhwani</u> for inviting and organising such event.
