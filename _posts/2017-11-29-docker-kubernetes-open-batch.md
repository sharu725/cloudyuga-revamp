In the last few months our focus had been to do corporate trainings and I think that would continue as usual. I have been getting lots of inquiries for individual and online classes. It is not that we don't want to do them but sometime managing the logistics and followup become too much of work, specially when you don't have dedicates sales team. 

As one small group confirmed for Docker and Kubernetes online trainings, so I thought of opening up for others as well. We'll be doing 2 days Docker workshop, followed by 3 days Kubernetes workshop. Both of these trainings are completely hands-on and if one attends both the trainings, then no prior knowledge of containers are required. After the class, the participant would be become comfortable in working with Docker and Kubernetes. 

The Docker training is scheduled on 23rd and 24th Dec'17, in which we'll start with containers basics and then cover basic and advance level of Docker. No prior knowledge of container technology is required to attend this training. For more details and registration, visit [here](https://cloudyuga.guru/trainings/online-docker/).

And the 3 days Kubernetes training is scheduled between 5th and 7th January'18. Prior knowledge of Docker is required to attend this training. In this training we'll do lots of hands-on labs to understand Kubernetes concepts and then play with advance Kubernetes constructs. This training would also be helpful to anyone, who is planning to take [Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/).

I guess this would be great opportunity for anyone, who wants learn about Docker and Kubernetes. 

So, see you in the class ....!!
