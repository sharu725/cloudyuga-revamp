[In the earlier blog post](http://www.cloudyuga.guru/?p=621) I mentioned that I would be doing a [Kubernetes workshop](https://rootconf.in/2017/kubernetes-workshop) and CloudYuga would be having  a booth at [rootconf&#8217;17.](https://rootconf.in/2017/)  On both conference days (11th and 12th May) I was at the booth and interacted with the participants. I could not even attend a single talk at the conference.

Though I have been behind the booth for Red Hat earlier but this was special. With the RootConf participants I shared the details about the [work we do and the trainings we offer to corporate and individuals.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1roRn8kg1SQNzRReUxMd3lFWVE/view?usp=sharing) On both days we did a lucky draw and gifted access to our online courses.

As a part of conference I did a [Kubernetes 101](https://rootconf.in/2017/kubernetes-workshop) workshop on 14th. 27 Participants attended the [workshop](https://github.com/cloudyuga/kubernetes101/).

It was fun filled last few days. Though they were tiring but gave us great experience. I must say building the marketing collateral and sharing it to people is a difficult task. I am glad that we could pull it off :).
