[LinuxCon, ContainerCon 2016 in Berlin](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe) was very special for me, as this is the first time I represented my company [CloudYuga](http://www.cloudyuga.guru/) as a speaker in an international conference. The event was scheduled between 4th to 7th Oct.&#8217;16 .

I reached there on 3rd Oct&#8217;16 and got a chance to meet [Jim Zemlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zemlin) Executive Director of  [The Linux Foundation.](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) On 4th, during the keynote [Solomon Hykes](https://twitter.com/solomonstre), Founder and CTO of Docker open-sourced [Infrakit](https://github.com/docker/infrakit), which is a toolkit for creating and managing declarative, self-healing infrastructure. It is currently used in Docker for AWS and other similar solution. Later in the day I attended sessions on _Comparing Container Orchestration_ tools by fellow Docker Captain [ Adrian Mouat](https://twitter.com/adrianmouat), _[Cgroups](http://man7.org/conf/lceu2016/cgroups-LinuxCon.eu_2016-Kerrisk.pdf)_ session by [Michael Kerrisk](http://man7.org/) and _Mircoservices vs Reverse-Proxy_ via [Emile Vague](https://twitter.com/emilevauge). In the evening I attended the speaker and sponsor&#8217;s party at [House of Weekend](http://www.houseofweekend.berlin/), Berlin.

On 5th I spent most of the time preparing for container orchestration workshop on 7th. Though I attended few sessions like _Getting started with Mesos_ Marathon by [Brenden Matthews](https://twitter.com/brndnmtthws),  _OCI session_ by [Qiang Huang](https://github.com/hqhq), _Docker Orchestration_ via [Aaron Lehmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronlehmann),  [Phil Estes](https://twitter.com/estesp) talk on container security and Migrating traditional & existing app on container by [ Scott McCarty](https://twitter.com/fatherlinux). In the evening I attended 25th Anniversary of Linux Celebration <a href="http://www.orangerie-charlottenburg.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer">The Great Orangery at Charlottenburg Palace</a>. There I got the chance to meet [Dan Kohn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankohn), Executive Director of [The Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) and discussed about t[he course I did for Linux Foundation, earlier this year](http://edx.org/course/introduction-cloud-infrastructure-linuxfoundationx-lfs151-x).

On 6th attended after attending one or two sessions I joined fellow Docker Captains for [Jerome ](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo)Docker Swarm workshop. After the workshop Solomon joined us for Q &A. He shared an interesting perspective on Docker &#8211; _**Docker**_ which has been there for quite some time and _**Docker**_ which is now evolving &#8230;

After that we had Docker Captain&#8217;s party at some nearby restaurant.

On 7th I delivered the hands-on session on [container orchestration](https://cloudyuga.gitbooks.io/container-orchestration/content/), in which I covered Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos Marathon. For Docker Swarm and Marathon I gave instances on DigitalOcean to each participant. For Kubernetes I created a cluster on Google Cloud and had a namespace created for each participant. I heard some good feedback about the workshop after the session was over.

After the session I went to attend Docker Distributed Summit for rest of the day. The summit had very good technical content. All of the videos are [recorded and would be shared soon](https://blog.docker.com/2016/10/docker-distributed-system-summit-videos-podcast-episodes/). I could not attend the second day of Summit as I had come back on 8th.

As always this had been a great experience. Learned a lot, met many interesting people and made some new friends.

People have been asking me who is funding your foreign trips as I attended DevConf in Brno,CZ and DockerCon in Seattle earlier this year as well.  I have been funding my own trips, which I think as investments. I got few leads from this conference as well. Hope I am in right path by doing so. Let&#8217;s see if I would have another blog post for overseas conference or not.
