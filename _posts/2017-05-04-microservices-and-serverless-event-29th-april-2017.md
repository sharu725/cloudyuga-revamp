On 29th April&#8217;17, April 8 different meetup groups of Bangalore came together and did joint event on Microservices and Serverless. The 8th meetups groups were [AWS](https://www.meetup.com/awsugblr/), [Azure](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/), [DevOps](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Meetup/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.meetup.com/DigitalOceanBangalore), [Docker](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/), [Hybrid Cloud](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Hybrid-Cloud-Infrastructure-as-a-Service-Meetup/), [Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Kubernetes-Meetup) and [Mesos](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Mesos-cncf-User-Group) Meetup groups. It was like a mini-conference :). ~250 people registered and from them ~200 came, which is pretty good turn around.

I think Ken Sipe&#8217;s talk on DC/OS and Shiju&#8217;s talk on Microservices were the highlight of the event. Due to some confusion my talk was not recorded. I gave a demo of [FaaS](https://github.com/alexellis/faas) by [Alex Ellis](http://alexellis.io/), using a custom twitter function. Thanks to all speakers for sharing their knowledge with us.

From the collected fee we would be giving a [gift voucher of INR 1500 each](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW6ivGckaZ-2a6fnlfSfSSj-5yK4uJM3ZQxeZVDPaSY/edit#gid=0) to our speakers. After all the sessions we had Q & A session with the participants as well. Participants who gave right answer, got a t-shirt from DigitalOcean and would be getting [a gift voucher from the collected fee as well. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW6ivGckaZ-2a6fnlfSfSSj-5yK4uJM3ZQxeZVDPaSY/edit#gid=0)
