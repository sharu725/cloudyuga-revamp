After doing the CloudYuga's trainings, participants wanted to get in touch and we have been getting reuqests to offer some career advice. We are good at what we know but certainly not expert in all **Cloud Technologies**. So we thought of starting a new Webinar series on peer learning - **CloudSocial**, where we all can learn from each other.   

This would be our first such webinar and the idea is to get some opinion on how we should structure it ? It would be an open dicussion to define the charter of this series.
