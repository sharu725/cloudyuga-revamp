[Dhilip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhilip-kumar-shankaranarayanan-8b403450/) started the meetup by giving some introduction and then he shared the agenda. I was first to go and talked about different [CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io).

Next was Krishna's talk, in which he covered current Kubernetes developement and eco-system model with OpenStack. It was a very intesresting talk. Hope, we as community learn from the ealrier mistakes and don't repeat it again.

We took a small break after Krishna's session and did the cake cutting. We requested all the Female partcipants to cut the the cake. 

After the break Irfan talked about [Kubernetes Cluster Federation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/federation/). Being a upstream developer to project, he shared some great insights. 

After the cluster federation talk, Kumar Gaurav talked [Kuberbetes Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) and how itcan be used to build serverless funtions. 

The last talk of the day was from Suraj Narwade about [Kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose), which can help users to create Kubernetes resources using Docker Compose file.

After all the sessions we had lunch, sponsored by Red Hat. Thanks to all speakers, our host and organisers of different meetup groups to make it happen.
