## **Overview** 

**Container Fundamentals** is a *self paced* online course, which would help you build solid foundation in container technologies. We would cover :-

- History and building blocks of containers
- Container Runtimes - runC, Docker and Rkt
- Container operations with runC, Docker and Rkt
- Image operations with Docker and Rkt
- Building Docker images with Dockerfiles
- Container networking and storage
- Building multi-container app with Docker
- Docker APIs
- and much more.

This course follows completely hands-on approach to learn about containers. To have a consistent lab environment we have partnered with DigitalOcean to provide self service lab. Each new or existing user of DigitalOcean would get **$15 credit** to perform the labs.
