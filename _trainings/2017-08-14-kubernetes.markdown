## **Overview** 

In this course we will learn about Kubernetes, which is a container orchestrator. We will look at its history and current architecture. We will learn about different resources is has like Pods, Services, Deployment etc and how to use them. Apart from a basic application, we would see how we can deploy and update a microservices based application on Kubernetes. We would also discuss about access methods, Kubernetes networking, volume management and many more things.Â We would also look at logging and monitoring with Kubernetes.

**Date**: TBD 

**Venue** : Bangalore
